## What is this?
This is an web app that I made for Imagine Cup - Earth (2016) and also won first position in the second round of it with this application. It predicts algae level in Bay of Bengal and shows it in form of a image. The predictions are based on user inputs on factors such as salinity of water, light intensity etc. (the whole list of factors that user can modify is avaliable below)
In addition to this the app also contains an interactive Q/A section on the right side of the screen. The questions in Q/A section changes according to the factor that user is modifying now.

The UI of the app is absolutely stunning and this is one of the best UI's designed by me.

_The app UI is designed for desktop size screens and may not look so appealing in mobiles/phones however the app will work on both platforms._

## Demo

## List of factors affecting algae that can be modified by user
* Fertilizer run-off from land
* Average temprature
* pH level of water
* Phosphorus content of water
* Salinity of water
* Light intensity

The algorithm to calculate algae level based on these levels was written by me after studying many articles on algae.
